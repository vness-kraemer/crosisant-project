        The history of the croissant can be traced back to Austria, where it was
        originally known as "kipferl." However, it was the French who truly
        elevated this crescent-shaped pastry to culinary stardom. Legend has it
        that Marie Antoinette introduced the kipferl to France when she married
        King Louis XVI in the late 18th century, and it was subsequently refined
        into the buttery delight we know today. The key to the croissant's
        exquisite texture lies in the lamination process, where layers of butter
        are folded into the dough through a series of careful folds and turns.
        This process creates the pastry's signature flakiness, with each bite
        offering a satisfying contrast of crispiness on the outside and a
        tender, airy interior.
