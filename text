Create a new Git repository called "Croissant" with 3 pages, index.html,
photo.html and contact.html. Add some text on the index and contact pages, add a
photo on the photo.html page and publish it to Netlify. Each page should link to
each other. Then, add some CSS, change the background color of the website and
deploy it again to Netlify. Deploy your website multiple times if needed. Submit
the Netlify URL of your project.
